In May 2018, we collected litter from Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge in Madison, IN, USA (38.965630, -85.364500) and transported it to the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL, USA. Microstegium vimineum has a mixed mating system of cleistogamous (obligately selfed, within leaf sheaths) and chasmogamous (potentially outcrossed, open) seeds (Baker and Dyer 2011). To minimize germination of cleistogamous seeds, we hand-picked them along with any non-M. vimineum material from the litter. We created three litter treatments within the range of litter observed at BONWR (Appendix S1): 0.91 g/pot (50 g/m2, “low”), 1.82 g/pot (100 g/m2, “medium”), 3.64 g/pot (200 g/m2, “high”), and a control treatment without litter (“none”). To enhance sporulation of pathogenic fungi in the litter, we incubated the litter for 56 hours at room temperature in one-gallon plastic bags with a paper towel saturated with deionized water. We collected M. vimineum seeds from BONWR in fall 2015 and purchased E. virginicus seeds from Prairie Moon Nursery (Winona, MN, USA) in spring 2018. On June 15, 2018, we planted three treatments: 50 seeds of E. virginicus, 50 seeds of M. vimineum (both “alone”; i.e., intraspecific competition), and 50 seeds of each (“in competition”; i.e., inter- and intraspecific competition), into 1 L (15.2 cm diameter) plastic pots filled with Metromix 930 growing medium (Sungro Horticulture, Agawam, MA, USA) saturated with tap water. We added the litter treatments to pots, creating twelve treatments (four litter treatments crossed with three planting treatments) with six replicates each. The following day, we topped each pot with a clear plastic sheet (50.8 cm width, 17.8 cm height; 0.005 Grafix Dura-Lar® film, Maple Heights, OH) formed into a cone to increase humidity and potentially enhance fungal sporulation. Cones were opened to cylinders as plants outgrew them. We placed pots under shade tents in the greenhouse to reduce heat stress (photosynthetically active radiation: 224 µMolm-2s-1 +/- 18 µMol m-2s-1), haphazardly rearranged them across two greenhouse benches weekly, and watered them daily. To measure establishment, we counted the number of plants per pot, and to measure disease incidence, we counted the proportion of plants per pot with at least two foliar lesions. We measured establishment and disease incidence weekly for six weeks. Some M. vimineum seedlings grew in E. virginicus-only pots, likely from cleistogamous seeds left in the litter despite our attempts to remove them. We counted and removed these seedlings. After 10 weeks, we cut plant stems at the soil surface and stored each species from each pot in a separate paper bag at 4°C. We then counted the number of M. vimineum plants and E. virginicus tillers (individuals were not identifiable) per pot, and the proportion with two or more foliar lesions. Because M. vimineum had few lesions, we searched for a maximum of ten minutes per M. vimineum per pot. Plants were then oven-dried at 60°C to a constant mass and weighed.
