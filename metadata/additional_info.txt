To run analyses, create an RStudio project with the following folders: code, data, intermediate-data, output. The code (files ending in .R) and data (files ending in .csv) from this archive should be placed in their respective folders. Run 'establishment_data_processing.R' first. Either 'biomass_analysis.R' or 'establishment_infection_analysis.R' can be run next to generate statistical models for biomass, establishment, and disease incidence. Run 'residual_infection_analysis.R' to generate statistical models for relationships between disease incidence and establishment or biomass. Run 'figures_values.R' to generate figures in manuscript. Run 'appendixS3.R' to generate figures in Appendix S3 of manuscript.
